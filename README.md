# Learning and Implementing KNN Algorithm
Predict a car's market price by applying KNN algorithm

This project is a learning instrument to understand the worflow of *K-Nearest Neighbors* algorithm for Calssification and Regression. KNN is a non-parametric method proposed by Thomas Cover, and is classified as supervised machine learning. More on KNN on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm#:~:text=k%20-NN%20is%20a%20type%20of%20instance-based%20learning%2C,and%20all%20computation%20is%20deferred%20until%20function%20evaluation).

The technical objective of the project is to predict a car's market price based on it's attributes(features) employing the KNN workflow. 

The dataset for this project was created and uploaded by Jeffrey C. Schlimmer at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset can be accessed from this [page](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data) and detailed description is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile). 

The original dataset is also attached with this repository.

Since GitHub does not render the plotly plots, that I originally built this project with here is the NBViewer link to access the same.
